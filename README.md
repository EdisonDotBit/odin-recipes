# odin-recipes

This project is all about creating "Odin Recipes" tasked by The Odin Project (Foundation Course), Project: Recipes Section. This project (website) will showcase what I have previously learned in the foundation course (from Introduction to Git & GitHub basics until HTML).

The website features a different set of recipes that allows us to click them and navigate to a page where it shows the image of finished meal, description, ingredients, and steps.
